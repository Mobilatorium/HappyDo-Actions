# Actions on Google: HappyDo TODO manager using Node.js and Cloud Functions for Firebase

This is a productivity Assistant app that allows to create task and read all tasks.

## Setup Instructions

See the developer guide and release notes at [https://developers.google.com/actions/](https://developers.google.com/actions/) for more details.

### Steps
1. Use the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com) to add a new project with a name of your choosing.
1. Under *Build a custom app*, click *BUILD* in the Dialogflow box and then click *Create Actions on Dialogflow*.
1. Click *Save* to save the project.
1. Click on the gear icon to see the project settings.
1. Select *Export and Import*.
1. Select *Restore from zip*. Follow the directions to restore from the `dialogFlow/demo-happydo.zip` file in this repo.
1. Deploy the fulfillment webhook provided in the `functions` folder using [Google Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/):
    1. Follow the instructions to [set up and initialize Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started#set_up_and_initialize_functions_sdk). Make sure to select the project that you have previously generated in the Actions on Google Console and to reply `N` when asked to overwrite existing files by the Firebase CLI.
    1. Run `firebase deploy --only functions` and take note of the endpoint where the fulfillment webhook has been published. It should look like `Function URL: https://${REGION}-${PROJECT}.cloudfunctions.net/dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment`
1. Go back to the Dialogflow console and select *Fulfillment* from the left navigation menu. Enable *Webhook*, set the value of *URL* to the `Function URL` from the previous step, then click *Save*.
1. Click *Test*.
1. Click *View* to open the Actions on Google simulator.
1. Type `Talk to my test app` in the simulator, or say `OK Google, talk to my test app` to any Actions on Google enabled device signed into your developer account.
